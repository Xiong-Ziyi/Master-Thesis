function SagData = zGetSag(SurfaceNumber, x, y)
% zGetSag - Returns the sag of any lens surface.
%
% Usage : SagData = zGetSag(SurfaceNumber, x, y)
% where SurfaceNumber is the surface number, and x and y are the coordinates on the surface for which 
% the sag is to be computed. The returned row vector is formatted as sag, alternatesag. 
% The values for x, y, and the sag are all in lens units.
