1) Update all zui* functions to cater for user pressing Cancel.
2) Update all zui* functions to include an initial path.
3) Consider timeouts on all functions. zOptimize.m. Identify all functions which might take longer than the timeout zOpenWIndow, zOptimize, zGetText, zGetMeta
4) Report ZEMAX Manual errors - eg. SetOperand
    a) SetSurfaceData for comment field seems to set the coating - reported already
    b) GetSystem and SetSystem return an additional undocumented parameter - what is it ?
    c) zGetPolTrace is incorrect for unpolarized rays as documented
    d) Can't set lens title and comments
    e) Can't seem to increase the number of multicon operands or configs.
5) revisit zsGetSurfaceDataVector, to eliminate problem with mismatched surface numbers wrt ZEMAX
6) Change all ddereq calls to include use of the timeout ZemaxDDETimeout, and add global ZemaxDDETimeout - done on most calls if not all - 11-Nov-02
7) Remove all calls that look like str2num(ddereq(...)), Rather first check to see if a response has been received.
   Particularly things like zGetSurfaceParamMatrix 
   This has mostly if not completely been done 18-Dec-02
9) Check and handle field type in NarcWiz.
10) Build Schott_Ancient Catalog, including KF1, LGSK2, SF51,
11) Request new ZEMAX functions
	a) Insert NSC Object.
        b) Insert Multicon operand
        c) Insert Configuration
12) Take another look at zSetMulticon, especially the help.
13) Add various to RCS, update zgetserial.
14) Add bugs to fix.txt to RCS.
